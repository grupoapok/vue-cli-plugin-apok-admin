# vue-cli-plugin-apok-admin

### The VueJS plugin for REST and GraphQL web client projects

This Vue-CLI plugin allows to scaffold a Vue application with build-in features for you to develop better and faster. The purpose of this package is to
generate a template that needs little to no configuration at all for you to start the developing process and, at the same time, being flexible enough to make
changes without vreaking your app. With this tool there's no need to worry about the base code; you'll have a fully working app in seconds by just inputing
a couple of commands. Just add what makes you app unique to the scaffold and get your app the features you want!
